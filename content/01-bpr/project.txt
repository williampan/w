Text:
*The Berkeley Poetry Review does not publish “political poetry.” It commits itself to publishing poetry from writers who understand their moment, the mechanisms, good and bad, that brought them there, and the words they need to move beyond. As James Goodwin writes in “Negritude: 6 Alienations”: past and future, cat and mouse.*&ensp;from Jules Wood’s editor’s note

Founded in 1974, the Berkeley Poetry Review is published annually at the University of California, Berkeley, featuring pieces from both new and established poets across the world. While aiming to continue the poetic tradition, it places particular interest in work that complicates prevailing views of race, gender, ecology, and poetic form. With this in mind, we designed the 45th issue with a classical reverence for the text, simultaneously respecting long-established typographic traditions and allowing the modernist tendencies of individual works to shine. The resulting publication is inconstant yet consistent, radical yet reserved.
