Text: Santa Barbara faces south, toward the ocean, so each day the sun rises at the east edge of the sea, shines upon the entire town and the mountains to the north, and sets on the other end of the pelagic horizon in warm and shimmering splendor. Each day glows full. Ecosystems thrive in the oaks and sycamores of the sandstone hills, in the eucalyptus trees that line the coast, and in the kelp forests beneath the surface of the channel.

Thus it is nearly impossible to grow up in the town and not be acutely aware of the environment â€” and of our violations thereof. This is the site, after all, of the 1969 oil spill: the one that prompted Earth Day, and the largest in America at the time. To this day eight oil platforms flicker in the middle distance, and to this day we must clean the tar off our feet after walking upon the beach. The works here are reflections on this precarious balance between nature and man, in Santa Barbara and beyond.
