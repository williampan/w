In high school, I served as editor and designer of *Local Color*, our art and literary magazine. Many of the works featured in the magazine focused perhaps too much on aestheticism — as would be expected from us young people of Santa Barbara, one of the most beautiful towns in America. The design displayed a similar fault, a similar virtue. It focused obsessively on the aesthetics of the presentation and pursued religiously Beatrice Warde’s ideal of the “crystal goblet”, employing a simple grid system, liberal whitespace, and a single Renaissance-inspired typeface at a single size. I am fond of this volume because I think its design and the works it showcases are successful in these terms, if in nothing else.
